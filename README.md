# ML-Modules

For this repository, I would like to introduce some basic modules on machine learning. 

In every file, there would be one algorithm fiinished by Python, in Jupyter Notebook. The theory parts come from my learning and understanding, and the codes are built from scratch. All the coeds have been tested on real data set before uploaded, working fine without bug and with pretty good forecast results. Though there are many great packages in Python or R, I believe it would be helpful to understand the theory behind them.

And the following is my plan, the modules are including: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbour, Anomaly Detection, Principle Component Analysis, Recommender System, K-Means, Neural Networks, and maybe Decision Tree(TBD). After I finished the theory and code part, I will make a summary to show how to use these with real data, and we will see their performance. Everyone could try to use them anythem, all codes have been tested before you can see them.

For any questions or suggestions, you can find me here:
